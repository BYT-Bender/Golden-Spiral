                        Let the two quantities a and b are in the golden ratio q, then<br>
                        <frac numerator="a + b" denominator="a"></frac> =  <frac numerator="a" denominator="a"></frac> = φ

                    <p>
                        One method for finding the value of @ is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in <frac numerator="b" denominator="a"></frac> = <frac numerator="1" denominator="φ"></frac>,<br>
                        <frac numerator="a + b" denominator="a"></frac> = 1 + <frac numerator="b" denominator="a"></frac> = 1 + <frac numerator="1" denominator="φ"></frac> = φ<br>
                        Therefore,<br>
                        1 + <frac numerator="1" denominator="φ"></frac> = φ.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Multiplying by φ gives φ + 1 = φ<sup>2</sup>, Which can be rearranged to<br>
                        φ<sup>2</sup> - φ - 1 = 0.<br>
                        Using the quadratic formula, two solutions are obtained:<br>
                        <frac numerator="1 + √5" denominator="2"></frac> = 1.618033988749... and <frac numerator="1 - √5" denominator="2"></frac> = -0.618033988749...<br>
                        Because φ is the ratio between positive quantities, it is necessarily the positive one.<br>
                        Therefore <frac numerator="1 + √5" denominator="2"></frac> = 1.618033988749... is the golden ratio.

                        In geometry, a golden spiral is a logarithmic spiral whose growth factor is φ, the golden ratio. That is, a golden spiral gets wider (or further from its origin) by a factor of φ for every quarter turn it makes. A Fibonacci spiral which approximate the golden spiral using Fibonacci sequence square sizes up to 34. The spiral is drawn starting from the inner 1 X 1 square and continues outwards to successively larger squares.

Our eye is naturally drawn to the center of the spiral, which is where it will look for details, so focus your design on the center of the spiral and place areas of visual interest within the spiral.

                        To estimate φ through the Fibonacci sequence, one calculates the ratio \[{F_{n} \over F_{n-1}}\] for successive terms. As n increases, these ratios approach the Golden Ratio. Mathematically, this convergence is expressed as \[lim_{x \to 2} {F_{n} \over F_{n-1}} = φ\]
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        This numerical convergence is a consequence of the recursive nature of the Fibonacci sequence, revealing an intrinsic connection with the Golden Ratio. The calculation of these ratios provides a tangible and illustrative method for estimating the Golden Ratio, offering a dynamic exploration of the mathematical beauty embedded in the Fibonacci sequence.

Even from the time of the Greeks, a rectangle whose sides are in the "golden proportion" has been known since it occurs naturally in some of the proportions of the Five Platonic. This rectangle is supposed to appear in many of the proportions of that famous ancient Greek temple in the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. The <span class="yellow">Taj Mahal</span> in India was also constructed using the Golden Ratio. The main building of the Taj Mahal was designed using the Golden Ratio. This is why it looks so perfect. The rectangles that served as the basic outline for the exterior of the building were all in the Golden Proportion. The Ahmes papyrus of Egypt gives an account of the building of the <span class="yellow">Great Pyramid of Giaz</span> in 4700 B.C. with proportions according to a "sacred ratio."
